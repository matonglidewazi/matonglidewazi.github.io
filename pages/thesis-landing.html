<h3> Abstract
</h3>

<div>
    More and more people are enjoying video contents online, while making video content accessible to people with
    disabilities remains challenging for both online video maker and service providers. This is especially true
    considering that the majority of online video are made without careful production, spreading over public platforms
    such as YouTube, or social medias such as Instagram.
    In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic audio description generation system. And with this pipeline as
    back-end, we propose a novel audio description scripting tool with content recommendation. Our aim is <b>to
        reduce the cost of production significantly, so that the amateur video makers and volunteers could produce audio
        description at low cost</b>. Ideally the users of this tool could provide online video accessibility with even
    several
    clicks and edits. The proposed pipeline consists of three stage: segmentation, description generation and synthesis.
    It takes an video content as input and generate synchronized subtitles and speech. And the scripting
    tool provides synchronized content recommendation for authors to select. While authoring the scripts, the author
    could choose to directly use the computer proposed content or adapt them to
    further use. Thus, the cost of scripting audio description is greatly reduced.

    Although the accuracy of the pipeline limits its direct deployment to serve people with visual impairment, the tool
    using it as back-end provides helpful information and could be an aid to people who produce audio description.
    Preliminary user testing with think aloud protocols shows that the system successfully reduces the amount of time
    people need to spend to describe one video and elevate
    their mental load.
